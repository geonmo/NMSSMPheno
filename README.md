#NMSSMPheno

For NMSSM phenomenology studies.

Basic overview:

1) Make MC complete with showering using Pythia8 (for signal processes) or MG5_aMC@NLO (for SM processes).

2) Run through Delphes for a detector simulation based around CMS (TODO)

3) Analyse with MadAnlaysis (TODO)

This system has been designed to run on various systems:
- Soolin at Bristol (HTCondor batch system)
- Iridis at Southampton (PBS batch system)

##Installation

- Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:raggleton/NMSSMPheno.git
