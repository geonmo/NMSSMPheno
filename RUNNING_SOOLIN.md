#RUNNING_IRIDIS

Instructions for running the complete chain on Soolin, using the HTCondor batch system.

There are a few steps:

1) Generate Monte Carlo events for signal or SM processes

2) Apply detector simulation

3) Analyse it all

##Generate Monte Carlo

SM processes are generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, whilst SUSY processes are generated with Pythia8. There are slightly different instructions for each.

###Standard Model: MG5_aMC@NLO

**TODO**

###SUSY: Pythia8

**TODO**

##Apply detector simulation

Detector simulation is applied using Delphes.

**TODO**

##Analysis
